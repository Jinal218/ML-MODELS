## Prerequisites

Before using the models in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Required libraries and dependencies (specified in models)

## Usage

Each model in this repository is organized into its own directory with a dedicated README file. Follow the instructions in the model's README file to:

1. Install the necessary dependencies.
2. Train the model on your own dataset (if applicable).
3. Use the pre-trained model for inference.
4. Fine-tune the model for your specific task (if needed).

## Models

Here is a list of some of the models included in this repository:

1. [Linear regression]():
   Overview: LR is a simple machine learning method for predicting continuous outcomes by finding linear relationships between input variables and the target 
   variable.

   Use Cases: Predicting house prices, sales forecasts, and understanding variable relationships.
  
   Variants: Simple LR (one input), Multiple LR (multiple inputs).
  
   Evaluation: Common metrics include MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2.
  
   LR is a fundamental tool for modeling linear relationships in data, widely used in various fields.



2. [K Nearest Neighbor]():
   Overview: KNN is a simple machine learning technique for classification and regression based on the similarity of data points.

   Use Cases: Classification, regression.
  
   Key Idea: Predicts by looking at the majority (classification) or averaging (regression) of the K-nearest data points.
  
   Applications: Recommenders, image recognition, anomaly detection.
  
   KNN is a straightforward algorithm for pattern recognition based on proximity, useful in various machine learning tasks.



3. [Support Vector Machine]():
   Overview: SVM is a powerful algorithm for classification and regression, ideal for high-dimensional data with optimal decision boundaries.

   Use Cases: Classification, regression.

   Key Features:
   Maximizes margin between classes using a hyperplane.
   Effective with small to medium-sized datasets.
   Handles non-linearity through kernels.
    
   Applications: Image classification, text classification, bioinformatics, and more.
    
   SVM is a robust algorithm known for its capacity to find optimal decision boundaries in complex data.
